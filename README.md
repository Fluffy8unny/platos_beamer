This project is about creating a situation akin to Plato's Cave for children on halloweeen. The input is their shapes and we're gonna project points with a beamer onto them, that they are able to destroy.

It's named after the Philosophical conect Plato came up, called Plato's Cave(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave Yeah he did stuff besides shitting on desks)!
